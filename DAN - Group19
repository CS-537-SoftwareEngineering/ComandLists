Information on Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) :

The DAN instrument will use the method of neutron-neutron activation analysis in a space application to study the 
abundance and depth distribution of water in the martian subsurface along the path of the MSL rover. DAN consist of 
two elements Detector Element and Pulse Neutron Generator.

Water is thought to be the most likely substance within Mars’ subsurface that contain hydrogen nuclei, 
so the detection of hydrogen in the soil is interpreted to mean the detection of water. Therefore, the neutron and 
gamma-ray data from the GRS suite can be used to produce global maps of water content in a shallow layer (1 m) of 
Mars’ subsurface.

The water content of martian soil from a surface platform, based on measurements of the dynamic albedo of neutrons 
induced by a pulse generator of 14 MeV neutrons. We will use neutron scattering (produced) with a pulse neutron generator) 
in the martian subsurface to provide an estimation of the concentration of hydrogen in the martian soil at depths  0.5 m.
